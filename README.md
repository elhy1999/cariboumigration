# Caribou Migration

This project explores the “Caribou Location Tracking” dataset which can be found in the tidytuesday repository: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-06-23

The dataset tracks the movements of caribous, an endangered species of animals, across Northern Canada. Our group has performed Exploratory Data Analysis from the datasets and have presented two of our most interesting findings. The project was completed entirely using the R programming language, and consists of numerous types of data visualizations. You can find our report in the form of a R Markdown (RMD) file, and the knitted HTML file in this repository.

The first insight involves the migration patterns of the caribous across Northern Canada. By making use of various external sources which tracked temperature patterns across different time periods, our group has made a few discoveries regarding the reason for the seemingly erratic nature of their migration patterns.

The second insight considers the causes of death amongst the caribous in different herds, and if it had an impact on their migration patterns.
